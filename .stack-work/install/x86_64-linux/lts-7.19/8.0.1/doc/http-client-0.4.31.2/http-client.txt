-- | Perform a <tt>Request</tt> using a connection acquired from the given
--   <tt>Manager</tt>, and then provide the <tt>Response</tt> to the given
--   function. This function is fully exception safe, guaranteeing that the
--   response will be closed when the inner function exits. It is defined
--   as:
--   
--   <pre>
--   withResponse req man f = bracket (responseOpen req man) responseClose f
--   </pre>
--   
--   It is recommended that you use this function in place of explicit
--   calls to <a>responseOpen</a> and <a>responseClose</a>.
--   
--   You will need to use functions such as <a>brRead</a> to consume the
--   response body.
--   
--   Since 0.1.0
withResponse :: Request -> Manager -> (Response BodyReader -> IO a) -> IO a

-- | A convenience wrapper around <a>withResponse</a> which reads in the
--   entire response body and immediately closes the connection. Note that
--   this function performs fully strict I/O, and only uses a lazy
--   ByteString in its response for memory efficiency. If you are
--   anticipating a large response body, you are encouraged to use
--   <a>withResponse</a> and <a>brRead</a> instead.
--   
--   Since 0.1.0
httpLbs :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Response ByteString)

-- | A convenient wrapper around <a>withResponse</a> which ignores the
--   response body. This is useful, for example, when performing a HEAD
--   request.
--   
--   Since 0.3.2
httpNoBody :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Response ())

-- | Get a <a>Response</a> without any redirect following.
httpRaw :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Response BodyReader)

-- | Get a <a>Response</a> without any redirect following.
--   
--   This extended version of <a>httpRaw</a> also returns the potentially
--   modified Request.
httpRaw' :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Request, Response BodyReader)

-- | The used Manager can be overridden (by requestManagerOverride) and the
--   used Request can be modified (through managerModifyRequest). This
--   function allows to retrieve the possibly overridden Manager and the
--   possibly modified Request.
--   
--   (In case the Manager is overridden by requestManagerOverride, the
--   Request is being modified by managerModifyRequest of the new Manager,
--   not the old one.)
getModifiedRequestManager :: Manager -> Request -> IO (Manager, Request)

-- | The most low-level function for initiating an HTTP request.
--   
--   The first argument to this function gives a full specification on the
--   request: the host to connect to, whether to use SSL, headers, etc.
--   Please see <a>Request</a> for full details. The second argument
--   specifies which <a>Manager</a> should be used.
--   
--   This function then returns a <a>Response</a> with a <a>BodyReader</a>.
--   The <a>Response</a> contains the status code and headers that were
--   sent back to us, and the <a>BodyReader</a> contains the body of the
--   request. Note that this <a>BodyReader</a> allows you to have fully
--   interleaved IO actions during your HTTP download, making it possible
--   to download very large responses in constant memory.
--   
--   An important note: the response body returned by this function
--   represents a live HTTP connection. As such, if you do not use the
--   response body, an open socket will be retained indefinitely. You must
--   be certain to call <a>responseClose</a> on this response to free up
--   resources.
--   
--   This function automatically performs any necessary redirects, as
--   specified by the <a>redirectCount</a> setting.
--   
--   When implementing a (reverse) proxy using this function or relating
--   functions, it's wise to remove Transfer-Encoding:, Content-Length:,
--   Content-Encoding: and Accept-Encoding: from request and response
--   headers to be relayed.
--   
--   Since 0.1.0
responseOpen :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Response BodyReader)

-- | Close any open resources associated with the given <tt>Response</tt>.
--   In general, this will either close an active <tt>Connection</tt> or
--   return it to the <tt>Manager</tt> to be reused.
--   
--   Since 0.1.0
responseClose :: Response a -> IO ()

-- | Apply 'Request'\'s <a>checkStatus</a> and return resulting exception

applyCheckStatus :: Request -> (Status -> ResponseHeaders -> CookieJar -> Maybe SomeException) -> Response BodyReader -> IO (Maybe SomeException)

-- | Redirect loop.
httpRedirect :: Int -> (Request -> IO (Response BodyReader, Maybe Request)) -> Request -> IO (Response BodyReader)

-- | Redirect loop.
--   
--   This extended version of <a>httpRaw</a> also returns the Request
--   potentially modified by <tt>managerModifyRequest</tt>.

parseStatusHeaders :: Connection -> Maybe Int -> Maybe (IO ()) -> IO StatusHeaders

-- | Deprecated synonym for <a>parseUrlThrow</a>. You probably want

-- | <i>Deprecated: Please use parseUrlThrow, parseRequest, or
--   parseRequest_ instead</i>
parseUrl :: MonadThrow m => String -> m Request

-- | Same as <a>parseRequest</a>, except will throw an <a>HttpException</a>
--   in the event of a non-2XX response.
parseUrlThrow :: MonadThrow m => String -> m Request

-- | Convert a URL into a <a>Request</a>.
--   
--   This defaults some of the values in <a>Request</a>, such as setting
--   <a>method</a> to GET and <a>requestHeaders</a> to <tt>[]</tt>.
--   
--   Since this function uses <a>MonadThrow</a>, the return monad can be
--   anything that is an instance of <a>MonadThrow</a>, such as <a>IO</a>
--   or <a>Maybe</a>.
--   
--   You can place the request method at the beginning of the URL separated
--   by a space, e.g.:
--   
--   @@<tt> parseRequeset "POST <a>http://httpbin.org/post"</a> </tt>@@
--   
--   Note that the request method must be provided as all capital letters.
parseRequest :: MonadThrow m => String -> m Request

-- | Same as <a>parseRequest</a>, but in the cases of a parse error

addProxy :: ByteString -> Int -> Request -> Request

-- | Add a Basic Auth header (with the specified user name and password) to

--   <pre>
--   applyBasicAuth "user" "pass" $ parseRequest_ url
--   </pre>
--   
--   Since 0.1.0
applyBasicAuth :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Request -> Request

--   </pre>
--   
--   Since 0.3.4
applyBasicProxyAuth :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Request -> Request

--   
--   Since 0.4.9
streamFile :: FilePath -> IO RequestBody

-- | Send a file as the request body, while observing streaming progress
--   via a <tt>PopObserver</tt>. Observations are made between reading and
--   sending a chunk.
--   
--   It is expected that the file size does not change between calling

--   body.
--   
--   Since 0.4.9
observedStreamFile :: (StreamFileStatus -> IO ()) -> FilePath -> IO RequestBody

-- | Extract basic access authentication info in URI. Return Nothing when
--   there is no auth info in URI.
extractBasicAuthInfo :: URI -> Maybe (ByteString, ByteString)

-- | If a request is a redirection (status code 3xx) this function will
--   create a new request from the old request, the server headers returned
--   with the redirection, and the redirection code itself. This function
--   returns <a>Nothing</a> if the code is not a 3xx, there is no
--   <tt>location</tt> header included, or if the redirected response
--   couldn't be parsed with <a>parseRequest</a>.
--   
--   If a user of this library wants to know the url chain that results
--   from a specific request, that user has to re-implement the
--   redirect-following logic themselves. An example of that might look
--   like this:
--   
--   <pre>
--   myHttp req man = do
--      (res, redirectRequests) &lt;- (`runStateT` []) $
--           'httpRedirect'

--   interval means "wait indefinitely". When specifying long timeouts, be
--   careful not to exceed <tt>maxBound :: Int</tt>.
--   
--   The design of this combinator was guided by the objective that
--   <tt>timeout n f</tt> should behave exactly the same as <tt>f</tt> as
--   long as <tt>f</tt> doesn't time out. This means that <tt>f</tt> has
--   the same <a>myThreadId</a> it would have without the timeout wrapper.

--   thrown to it by another thread.
--   
--   A tricky implementation detail is the question of how to abort an
--   <tt>IO</tt> computation. This combinator relies on asynchronous
--   exceptions internally. The technique works very well for computations
--   executing inside of the Haskell runtime system, but it doesn't work at
--   all for non-Haskell code. Foreign function calls, for example, cannot
--   be timed out with this combinator simply because an arbitrary C
--   function cannot receive asynchronous exceptions. When <tt>timeout</tt>
--   is used to wrap an FFI call that blocks, no timeout event can be
--   delivered until the FFI call returns, which pretty much negates the
--   purpose of the combinator. In practice, however, this limitation is
--   less severe than it may sound. Standard I/O functions like
--   <a>hGetBuf</a>, <a>hPutBuf</a>, Network.Socket.accept, or
--   <a>hWaitForInput</a> appear to be blocking, but they really don't
--   because the runtime system uses scheduling mechanisms like
--   <tt>select(2)</tt> to perform asynchronous I/O, so it is possible to
--   interrupt standard socket I/O or file I/O using this combinator.

-- | <h1>Simpler API</h1>
--   
--   The API below is rather low-level. The <tt>Network.HTTP.Simple</tt>
--   module (from the <tt>http-conduit</tt> package) provides a
--   higher-level API with built-in support for things like JSON request
--   and response bodies. For most users, this will be an easier place to
--   start. You can read the tutorial at:
--   
--   
--   <a>https://github.com/commercialhaskell/jump/blob/master/doc/http-client.md</a>
--   
--   <h1>Lower-level API</h1>
--   
--   This is the main entry point for using http-client. Used by itself,
--   this module provides low-level access for streaming request and
--   response bodies, and only non-secure HTTP connections. Helper packages
--   such as http-conduit provided higher level streaming approaches, while
--   other helper packages like http-client-tls provide secure connections.
--   
--   There are three core components to be understood here: requests,
--   responses, and managers. A <a>Manager</a> keeps track of open
--   connections to various hosts, and when requested, will provide either
--   an existing open connection or create a new connection on demand. A
--   <a>Manager</a> also automatically reaps connections which have been
--   unused for a certain period of time. A <a>Manager</a> allows for more
--   efficient HTTP usage by allowing for keep-alive connections. Secure
--   HTTP connections can be allowed by modifying the settings used for
--   creating a manager. The simplest way to create a <a>Manager</a> is
--   with:
--   
--   <pre>
--   <a>newManager</a> <a>defaultManagerSettings</a>
--   </pre>
--   
--   While generally speaking it is a good idea to share a single
--   <a>Manager</a> throughout your application, there are cases where it
--   makes more sense to create and destroy <a>Manager</a>s more
--   frequently. As an example, if you have an application which will make
--   a large number of requests to different hosts, and will never make
--   more than one connection to a single host, then sharing a
--   <a>Manager</a> will result in idle connections being kept open longer
--   than necessary. In such a situation, it makes sense to use
--   <a>withManager</a> around each new request, to avoid running out of
--   file descriptors. (Note that the <a>managerIdleConnectionCount</a>
--   setting mitigates the risk of leaking too many file descriptors.)
--   
--   The next core component is a <a>Request</a>, which represents a single
--   HTTP request to be sent to a specific server. <a>Request</a>s allow
--   for many settings to control exact how they function, but usually the
--   simplest approach for creating a <a>Request</a> is to use
--   <a>parseRequest</a>.
--   
--   Finally, a <a>Response</a> is the result of sending a single
--   <a>Request</a> to a server, over a connection which was acquired from
--   a <a>Manager</a>. Note that you must close the response when you're
--   done with it to ensure that the connection is recycled to the
--   <a>Manager</a> to either be used by another request, or to be reaped.
--   Usage of <a>withResponse</a> will ensure that this happens
--   automatically.
--   
--   Helper packages may provide replacements for various recommendations
--   listed above. For example, if using http-client-tls, instead of using
--   <a>defaultManagerSettings</a>, you would want to use
--   <tt>tlsManagerSettings</tt>. Be sure to read the relevant helper
--   library documentation for more information.
--   
--   A note on exceptions: for the most part, all actions that perform I/O
--   should be assumed to throw an <a>HttpException</a> in the event of
--   some problem, and all pure functions will be total. For example,
--   <a>withResponse</a>, <a>httpLbs</a>, and <a>BodyReader</a> can all
--   throw exceptions. Functions like <a>responseStatus</a> and
--   <a>applyBasicAuth</a> are guaranteed to be total (or there's a bug in
--   the library).
--   
--   One thing to be cautioned about: the type of <a>parseRequest</a>
--   allows it to work in different monads. If used in the <a>IO</a> monad,
--   it will throw an exception in the case of an invalid URI. In addition,
--   if you leverage the <tt>IsString</tt> instance of the <a>Request</a>
--   value via <tt>OverloadedStrings</tt>, an invalid URI will result in a
--   partial value. Caveat emptor!
--   
--   Non-2xx responses: the default behavior of all functions in
--   http-client is to automatically perform up to 10 redirects (response
--   codes 301, 302, 303, and 307), and to throw a
--   <a>StatusCodeException</a> on all responses whose status are not in
--   the 2xx range. These behaviors can be overridden by the
--   <a>redirectCount</a> and <a>checkStatus</a> settings on a request,
--   respectively.

--   Since 0.1.0
httpLbs :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Response ByteString)

-- | A convenient wrapper around <a>withResponse</a> which ignores the

--   request.
--   
--   Since 0.3.2
httpNoBody :: Request -> Manager -> IO (Response ())

-- | The most low-level function for initiating an HTTP request.
--   
--   The first argument to this function gives a full specification on the
--   request: the host to connect to, whether to use SSL, headers, etc.
--   Please see <a>Request</a> for full details. The second argument
--   specifies which <a>Manager</a> should be used.
--   
--   This function then returns a <a>Response</a> with a <a>BodyReader</a>.
--   The <a>Response</a> contains the status code and headers that were
--   sent back to us, and the <a>BodyReader</a> contains the body of the
--   request. Note that this <a>BodyReader</a> allows you to have fully
--   interleaved IO actions during your HTTP download, making it possible
--   to download very large responses in constant memory.
--   
--   An important note: the response body returned by this function
--   represents a live HTTP connection. As such, if you do not use the
--   response body, an open socket will be retained indefinitely. You must
--   be certain to call <a>responseClose</a> on this response to free up
--   resources.
--   
--   This function automatically performs any necessary redirects, as
--   specified by the <a>redirectCount</a> setting.
--   
--   When implementing a (reverse) proxy using this function or relating
--   functions, it's wise to remove Transfer-Encoding:, Content-Length:,
--   Content-Encoding: and Accept-Encoding: from request and response
--   headers to be relayed.

--   
--   If you simply wish to download from a URL, see <tt>parseRequest</tt>.

--   
--   Moreover, the Accept-Encoding header is set implicitly to gzip for
